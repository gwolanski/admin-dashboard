# admin-dashboard

The Admin Dashboard Project was essentially a project where we were given a picture of a dashboard web page and told to recreate it. This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The project directions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard

I often find myself on dashboard webpages, so this was great practice for creating a webpage that is very relevant to today's society. This project was carried out using various HTML and CSS elements, but had a large focus on the use of CSS grids. I'm finding that grids are a lot of fun to work with and are a great tool for web design. I consider this project to be a good reflection of my design skillset.
